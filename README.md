CriticalMaterialsBI is a data analytics solution built on Microsoft Fabric to assess raw material risks, supplier dependencies, and risk-mitigating priorities for a fictional manufacturer. The project simulates a real-world business intelligence (BI) workflow by integrating on-premise databases, streaming data, and synthetic datasets to support strategic decision-making.

🚀 Key Features
- On-Premise Database Simulation – Local SQL databases representing product, material, and supplier data.
- Live Streaming Data – Web-scraped and Python-generated price updates for key materials.
- Critical Raw Materials Mapping – Connecting supplier-purchased materials to EU-defined critical raw materials for risk assessment.
- Supplier Risk Analytics – Identifying and prioritizing risk mitigation efforts based on supply chain vulnerabilities.
- Microsoft Fabric Integration – Cloud-based analytics and reporting using Power BI and Fabric data services.

🔧 Technologies Used
- Microsoft Fabric (Data Factory, Power BI, Lakehouse)
- SQL (On-Prem Database Simulation)
- Python (Web scraping, synthetic data generation, streaming data simulation)
- Power BI (Dashboards & reports)

🎯 Project Goals
- Simulate a real-world manufacturing data pipeline with on-premise and cloud analytics.
- Provide insights into the manufacturer's supply chain risks, particularly those related to critical raw materials.
- Demonstrate how streaming data can enhance material risk assessment and decision-making.
